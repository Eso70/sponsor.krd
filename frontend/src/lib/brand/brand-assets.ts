/**
 * Single source of truth for branding asset fallbacks.
 *
 * The distinction this module exists to enforce: `/images/Logo.jpg` is
 * SponsorKrd's own mark. It belongs to platform chrome — the home page, the
 * dashboard sidebar, the "powered by" footer, the platform manifest — and must
 * never stand in for a business that has not uploaded its own logo or favicon.
 * Painting the platform's logo onto a tenant surface misrepresents that
 * business, so tenant surfaces fall back to the neutral placeholders below.
 *
 * `DEFAULT_AVATAR` is a special case: it is also the value stored in
 * `business_branding.default_avatar` when no avatar was chosen, so backend SQL
 * compares against this exact string to mean "still the default". Changing it
 * requires a data migration, not just an edit here — see
 * `backend/src/common/brand-assets.ts`.
