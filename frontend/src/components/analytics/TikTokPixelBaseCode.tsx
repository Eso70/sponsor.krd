 * base code in the raw HTML is what makes TikTok's "verify Pixel setup"
 * crawler find the tag: a script injected only after React hydrates is
 * invisible to a snapshot taken before that.
 *
 * This is a server component: it renders once, into the HTML the crawler and
 * the browser both receive, and it never re-renders on soft navigation — the
 * client tracker (`TikTokPixel`) owns page views and replay of events.
