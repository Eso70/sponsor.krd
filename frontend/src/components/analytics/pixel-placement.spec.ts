/**
 * Where the TikTok pixel is allowed to exist.
 *
 * Approved public marketing surfaces are the pages a business actually sends
 * ad traffic to, and they are the only places a pixel earns its keep.
 *
 * Everywhere else is excluded on purpose. A business signing in or editing
 * their own page is not an audience, and reporting those visits pollutes the
 * very pixel the public pages use — the owner's own sessions get counted as
 * traffic and train the ad algorithm on the wrong people. The subdomain
 * landing page, the advertising page, the platform's own root domain and the
 * admin console are all out for the same reason. See docs/tracking.md.
 *
 * This is asserted structurally rather than by rendering, because the failure
 * it guards against is someone mounting the component somewhere new, which no
 * behavioural test of the existing pages would notice.
