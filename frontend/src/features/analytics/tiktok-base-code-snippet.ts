 * base code" failure with Pixel Helper already working. Rendering this inline
 * puts the `ttq` stub and the `events.js` URL in the raw HTML, so the tag is
 * detected and starts loading at parse time — before hydration.
 *
 * It deliberately does not call `ttq.page()`: the first page view belongs to
 * the client tracker, which reports it once per mount with an `event_id` that
 * the server half shares. A second `page()` here would be a PageView with no
 * deduplicating id, counted twice.
 *
 * Re-running the snippet (soft navigation into a page that re-renders it)
 * must not re-inject `events.js`: the `_i` registry is checked per pixel
 * before creating each script element, so a second pass initialises nothing.
