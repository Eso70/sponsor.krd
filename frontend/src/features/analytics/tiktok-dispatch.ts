/**
 * The only module in the app that touches `window.ttq`.
 *
 * There used to be two copies of the queue stub — one that loaded the pixel and
 * one that fired events — which meant two definitions of what the global looked
 * like and two chances for a page to report through a half-built queue. The
 * placement test in `components/analytics/pixel-placement.spec.ts` enforces
 * that this stays the single dispatcher.
 *
 * Nothing here throws. Analytics must never be the reason a public page breaks,
 * so every entry point is a no-op when the pixel is absent or the browser
 * refused it.
