# Testing and verification

Everything, in one command:

```bash
pnpm verify
```

That runs lint, type-check, test, and build across both applications. `lint`
and `type-check` never write to the working tree, so the same command is
safe in CI. Use `pnpm lint:fix` when you do want ESLint to apply fixes.

Individual applications:

```bash
pnpm --filter backend lint
pnpm --filter backend type-check
pnpm --filter backend test
pnpm --filter backend test:e2e
pnpm --filter backend build
```

```bash
pnpm --filter frontend lint
pnpm --filter frontend type-check
pnpm --filter frontend test
pnpm --filter frontend build
```

## End-to-end suite

`pnpm test:e2e` needs no environment set up by hand.
`backend/test/e2e-environment.ts` runs before any module loads and resolves
what the suite depends on:

- It loads the `.env` files in the same order the migration scripts do.
  `migration-upgrade.e2e-spec.ts` connects with raw `pg` pools and had nothing
  to load them, so the run used to die on the first connection with
  `client password must be a string`.
- It pins `ROOT_DOMAIN=localhost`. Every injected request is addressed to a
  `<subdomain>.localhost` host and `BusinessGuard` derives the tenant by
  stripping the root domain off it, so a developer value such as
  `lvh.me:3011` leaves no derivable subdomain and a valid session is rejected
  as `Invalid business session`. The `x-subdomain` header is not a way around
  that — `internal-proxy-trust.ts` ignores it without an internal proxy key.
- It defaults `DB_NAME` to `sponsor_krd_e2e`, and never overrides a name that
  already looks disposable. Both suites truncate tables and drop databases,
  and both refuse to run against a name that does not look disposable; this
  only supplies a safe default.

An e2e spec must not depend on the developer's `.env`. Anything it needs goes
in that setup file, so the result is the same on every machine.

No fixed passing-test count is documented because the suite changes with the
code. Use the command output from the current revision as the source of
truth.

## Proportionate verification

Do not run every repository test after every localized change. Verification
must be proportional to the scope and risk of the work:

- Run the directly related unit, component, or integration tests for a
  localized change.
- Run the affected application's type check or lint only when the change can
  influence types, imports, framework rules, or shared code.
- Run an affected production build when changing routing, framework
  boundaries, build configuration, or server/client composition.
- Run a complete application or repository suite only for broad cross-cutting
  changes, shared infrastructure changes, security-sensitive work, database
  changes, release preparation, or when focused verification reveals possible
  wider impact.

Do not repeatedly rerun an unchanged full suite within the same task. Record
the successful result and rerun only the checks affected by subsequent edits.
This keeps feedback fast and avoids consuming unnecessary development time and
compute while preserving risk-based confidence.

Application-specific lint/build/dev commands are in
[docs/frontend.md](frontend.md#commands) and
[docs/backend.md](backend.md#commands). Database commands are in
[docs/database.md](database.md).

Schema-command verification must cover fresh, complete-current, supported
unledgered, partial/unknown, failed, rerun, and concurrent `db:migrate` paths,
plus a `db:reset` path that proves an unrelated sentinel table is removed and
the consolidated schema is recreated. Use only disposable PostgreSQL and Redis
services. Never run `db:reset` against valuable data.

Request-boundary tests cover malformed UUIDs, pagination bounds, invalid enum
actions, unknown/invalid bulk-link payloads, both supported batch-link shapes,
invalid nested URLs and deletion IDs, and valid payload preservation.

Response-boundary tests exercise the real Nest/Fastify serialization path.
They cover canonical and legacy-compatible internal successes, validation
details, and generic unexpected failures.

Frontend request-boundary tests cover shared credentials/cache defaults, JSON
serialization, M2 envelope unwrapping, normalized error metadata, and abort
preservation. Feature-hook tests continue to cover domain normalization and
local state transitions independently from transport parsing.

Shared-dialog tests cover focus entry, forward and reverse focus containment,
and restoration to the element that opened the dialog.

Administration-query tests verify pagination transformation and maximum
limits, secret-free business list projections, and bounded billing joins.

H6 characterization coverage protects extracted hotspot seams: public-page
projections retain every required alias, while the business analytics hook
preserves summary normalization, initial loading, and reset behavior.

Repository tests protect the persistence seams for analytics reads, business
administration, and billing. They assert tenant and
publication constraints, bounded pagination inputs, and the identifiers used
to target cache invalidation. Service characterization tests continue to
protect response mapping and transaction orchestration.

Authorization tests verify that Linktree creation uses the public-page quota
and that the quota query reads the tenant-owned Linktree table.

Module-boundary tests keep the global-module allowlist limited to PostgreSQL
and Redis and assert the explicit auth, billing, and observability imports of
their consuming domains.

Public-read tests protect the subdomain-scoped Linktree lookup and assert that
the removed unscoped legacy method is not exposed again.

Security-gap regression tests verify authentication, tenant isolation, request
validation, rate limiting, and authorization boundaries. CSP tests require a
per-request nonce plus `'strict-dynamic'`, reject
`'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src`, and keep `'unsafe-eval'` development-only.
Retention tests cover the communication-history policy and eligible counts.

## Critical architecture E2E matrix

CI runs the backend E2E suite against disposable PostgreSQL and Redis
services after applying the real migration command. The compact matrix covers:

- public process liveness and complete `AppModule` startup;
- business login for two tenants and the separate platform-administrator
  authentication domain;
- cookie-origin rejection, per-request subdomain binding, and cross-tenant
  resource denial;
- tenant-owned Linktree creation;
- a supported pre-baseline schema fixture being verified and baselined without
  replaying schema SQL;
- a reset fixture proving the whole database is dropped and recreated solely
  from `full_schema.sql`.

The application fixture refuses to run unless `DB_NAME` contains an explicit
`e2e` or `test` segment. The migration fixture uses a generated
`sponsor_krd_migration_e2e_*` database and removes it after the suite. E2E tests
run in band so database setup, worker assertions, and cleanup remain
deterministic.

### Running the e2e suite

`pnpm test:e2e` on its own fails by design: the development `DB_NAME`
(`sponsor_krd`) has no `e2e`/`test` segment, and the fixtures are destructive.
It needs a disposable database, created once and provisioned with the same
consolidated schema:

```bash
# once: create the database, then apply full_schema.sql to it
DB_NAME=linktree_e2e pnpm db:migrate

# every run: the suite reads DB_* from the environment, not from .env
DB_HOST=... DB_PORT=... DB_USER=... DB_PASSWORD=... DB_NAME=linktree_e2e pnpm test:e2e
```

The `DB_*` variables must be exported rather than left to `.env`: the e2e
fixtures open their own pools before Nest's config module loads, so an unset
`DB_PASSWORD` surfaces as `SASL: client password must be a string` rather than
as a missing-configuration error.
