/**
 * Whether a business's plan *currently* carries a boolean entitlement.

 * A SQL fragment rather than a service call because every caller needs it
 * inside a larger query — public reads, the public business payload, the
 * migration seeds — and a hand-written copy in each is how one of them quietly
 * starts disagreeing with the others.
 *
 * Why this is re-evaluated on every public read rather than trusted from
 * whenever the page was published: a `status = 'published'` column records what
 * the owner chose while they still had the feature, and nothing rewrites it
 * when the plan changes. Without a live check, downgrading leaves paid public
 * surfaces online that the business can no longer open, edit, or take down.
 *
 * Correlates on `<alias>.id`, so the query must expose a `businesses` alias.

 * fragment builder that skips the check is one refactor away from splicing a
 * column name that came from a request.
