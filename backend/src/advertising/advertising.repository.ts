/**
 * Every list is replaced whole inside one transaction: rows whose editor key is
 * absent from the incoming list are deleted, the rest are upserted with their
 * array index as `position`. Editor keys have to be stable — a
 * regenerated id would read as "delete the old row, insert a new one" and take
 * anything attached to it along.
 *
 * Publishing deliberately registers no `public_page_actions` rows. The
 * advertising page is not one of the two surfaces allowed to report to TikTok
 * (docs/tracking.md), `TIKTOK_FORWARDED_PAGE_TYPES` excludes it, and neither
 * public advertising component calls the page tracker — so an action row here
 * would report a permanent zero and pad every analytics breakdown with noise,
 * which is the exact failure docs/tracking.md warns about. If ad-page
 * engagement should appear in a business's own analytics, that is an
 * internal-only tracking feature to design, not a row to write here.
