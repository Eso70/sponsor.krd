/**
 * The single policy that decides what a platform administrator may NOT do
 * while signed in as a business.
 *
 * Impersonation deliberately grants the business's own effective access and
 * nothing more: the session carries `role: 'business'`, so plan entitlements,
 * quotas, and per-permission approval rules apply exactly as they do for the
 * real owner. This denylist is the narrow exception on top of that — the two
 * primitives an administrator must not reach through a borrowed session:
 *
 * 1. Reading a decrypted tenant secret back in plaintext. The administrator
 *    can already rotate TikTok credentials through the guarded platform route;
 *    there is no support reason to exfiltrate the existing value.
 * 2. Revoking the real owner's sessions from inside the tenant. The platform
 *    console owns that action under its own capability, where
 *    it is attributed to the administrator rather than to the business.
 *
 * Keeping both rules here means widening or relaxing the policy is a change to
 * this file only. Route guards must not grow their own private exceptions.
