/**
 * Applies dated forward migration files from `backend/src/database/migrations`
 * that are not yet recorded in `schema_migrations`.
 *
 * The numbered baseline is applied and recorded separately by `db-migrate.ts`
 * under `full_schema.sql` and is never replayed here. A dated
 * `YYYY-MM-DD_description.sql` file is a forward migration: a small, additive,
 * idempotent-where-possible change delivered against an already-baselined
 * database.
 *
 * `db-migrate.ts` calls this after applying or verifying the baseline.
 * `db-reset.ts` never calls it: a reset always recreates the database from
 * the numbered baseline and asserts the ledger contains only that one row by
 * design, so it only ever represents a database's current baseline, not the
 * accumulated history a live database goes through. The numbered baseline is
 * refreshed to match that accumulated state as a separate, periodic
 * maintenance step, never as part of shipping an individual forward
 * migration.
 *
 * Ordering and identity both come from the filename. Files are applied in
 * ascending filename order, so the `YYYY-MM-DD_description.sql` convention
 * documented in docs/database.md is what determines apply order — not
 * directory listing order, which is not guaranteed across platforms. Each
 * file is applied in its own transaction and recorded in `schema_migrations`
 * by that exact filename, matching the same ledger `full_schema.sql` uses, so
 * a file already recorded is skipped on every future run: adding a new
 * migration file and rerunning `pnpm db:migrate` is always safe, including on
 * a live database that already has some earlier migrations applied.
 *
 * A failed migration rolls back that one file's transaction and stops the
 * run immediately — later files are never applied out of order, and nothing
 * is recorded for the failed file.
