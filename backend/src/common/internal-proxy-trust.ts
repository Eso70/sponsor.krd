/**
 * Verifies that a subdomain claimed by an inbound `x-subdomain` header
 * actually came from a trusted internal caller (the Next.js proxy) rather
 * than an external client.
 *
 * `x-subdomain` alone is not a security boundary: Caddy strips it from
 * inbound traffic before forwarding, but that protection lives entirely in
 * infrastructure configuration, not in this process. A client that reaches
 * the backend directly — a misconfigured port, an internal network path, or
 * local development without Caddy in front — could otherwise set
 * `x-subdomain: victim-tenant` and have `BusinessGuard` treat it as
 * authoritative, letting a session issued for one tenant pass the subdomain
 * check for another.
 *
 * The proxy sends this key alongside `x-subdomain` on every forwarded
 * request (see `frontend/src/proxy.ts` and
 * `frontend/src/app/api/[...path]/route.ts`). The header is trusted only
 * when this comparison succeeds; otherwise callers fall back to parsing the
 * `Host` header directly, which cannot be forged into a different tenant
 * without also forging DNS/TLS for that tenant's subdomain.
 *
 * Uses `INTERNAL_PROXY_SECRET` with `SESSION_SECRET` as the rollout fallback.
