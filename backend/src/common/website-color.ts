 * `#rgb`, `#rrggbb`, or `gradient:<direction>:<hex>:<hex>` — the same rule the
 * browser's `parseWebsiteColor` reads back, because every one of these values
 * is rendered as an inline CSS background. Four hand-written copies of this
 * regex had drifted apart: two accepted `#abcd`, which is not a colour any
 * browser draws; one accepted six digits only, which rejected a shorthand the
 * colour picker could produce; and the linktree background accepted any string
 * at all. Validate against this constant rather than writing a fifth.
