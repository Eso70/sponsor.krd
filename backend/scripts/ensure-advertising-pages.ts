/**
 * Gives every business that is entitled to the feature a draft advertising page.
 *
 * Draft, not published. Seeding a live page would put a public URL in front of
 * visitors that nobody has ever looked at, and the starting content is
 * deliberately thin — no testimonials, results or payment details. The owner
 * publishes when the page says what they want it to say.
 *
 * Entitled only: the advertising permissions require `feature.advertising_page`,
 * which only the top plan carries. Seeding a page for a business that cannot
 * open the editor would create a row it can neither see nor remove.
 *
 * Idempotent: businesses that already have a page are skipped entirely, so a
 * rerun never overwrites edited content. Schema is owned by migrations.
